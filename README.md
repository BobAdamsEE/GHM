# GHM

This repository contains files that attempt to clone parts of the Google
Home Mini smart home assistant. The final intention is to have the 
ability to make custom designs that re-use the housing and speaker of
the original.

## Goals

* Clone Input PCBA (Design DONE, Fit test TODO)
* Document constraints of main PCBA (clearance, LED placement)
* Document speaker parameters
* Create open source main PCBA with TBD features
